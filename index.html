      <h1>Project 4 Development</h1>
      <h2>Dead (Meme) Drops - Keegan Edwards</h2>
      <h2></h2>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>For project 4 I was initially pretty unsure as to what I was going to do. I liked the idea of using memes and I really wanted to make something physical out of them, 3D printing if I could.</p>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>After watching one of the videos in a class lecture I took precedece from Aram Bartholl's work with Dead Drops. A usb Dead Drop is a usb memory stick that has been cemented into a wall, people can then plug there laptop or phones (with an adapter) into the usb and share files anonymously . Bartholl started a Dead Drop project in 2010, cementing five usbs into walls around New York and setting up an offline peer to peer file sharing network. Since then the project has expanded around the world with over 1,400 Dead Drops known in dozens of countries.<br>
      I thought that this was an interesting idea, that people could share files anonymously offline by visiting one of these locations. Of course it does pose a risk in that people could plant malware or other 'booby traps' on the memory sticks, but this is also a risk downloading stuff online as well. I want to recreate this offline file sharing while mixing in Internet culture and humor by incorporating memes on the memory sticks that could be viewed, shared and added to.</p>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>I started to look online for 3D models that I could use to print. On Thingiverse I found a few different models that are related to memes in some way such as, a Ugandan Knuckles, a Bowsette super crown and a Philosoraptor. After thinking about what sort of memes I wanted to use I decided to grab an 'It's Wednesday my Dudes' frog and a 'Dickbutt' model.<br>
      They were both free and open under creative commons licences. For the third model I really wanted to print a moth as the Moth Lamp memes are very popular at the moment, but I couldn't find a model online so I decided to design one myself.</p>

      <div class="breakline"></div>
      
      <p>I used 3D Coat to sculpt a moth model to use. I am really quite happy with how it came out, I wasn't so sure I'd be able to sculpt anything to great.</p>
      <div class="images">
        <img src="images/moth.jpg" alt="moth sculpt">
      </div>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>I also pulled the other two models into 3D Coat so that I could cut a rectangle into them to house the USB sticks. I then used Meshmixer to properly scale the models and export them as stl files ready for the 3D printers.</p>

        <img src="images/dickbutt_hole.jpg" alt="dickbutt with USB hole">
      </div>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>A friend of mine in the Industrial Design course helped me to set up the prints. We printed the moth and frog with white PLA filament and the Dickbutt with PLA Wood filament for something a bit different. All the prints went well, although the first moth print we ran out of filament halfway through so had to start it again.<br>
      Once the prints finished I spent quite some time cutting and ripping all the support material off them and sanding them down a bit to smooth out the print lines.</p>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>I decided that the white prints looked a bit dull so I used some standard acrylic paints to colour them, I'm not super happy with the paint jobs as they look a bit dirty but it definitly helped to liven them up. For the Dickbutt, after sanding I rubbed some wood stain in, which darkened and made the model look a little less flat.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>I then scoured the internet to make collections of memes to put on the USBs in the models. I found about 20 related memes for each model.</p>

      <div class="breakline"></div>

      <p>I also made a poster that explains a little of the history of each of the models and their memes and includes some instructions for what to do with them.</p>
